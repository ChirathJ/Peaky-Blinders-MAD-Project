This mobile app can be used for inventory management in various fields such as food, beverages, clothes, pharmaceuticals, cleaning products, baby products, and chemicals, etc. Since this is not confined to a particular geographical location, it can be used for inventory management worldwide. This encourages the users to proceed with their business activities while expanding their horizons to global markets.
